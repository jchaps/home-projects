## Bridging FiOS Gateway Router

Note that a Gateway router isn't necessary to accomplish the bridging; any old FiOS router will do. The Gateway router is actually overkill since it only serves the MOCA portion of the network (e.g., STBs), so if you can save some $$ by using a lower grade router, do it.

Make sure the existing FiOS router is working properly before starting.

1. Record information from the FiOS router

2. Prepare replacement router

3. Prepare back-end router

4. Install replacement router

5. Install back-end router

6. Configure FiOS Gateway Router

7. Install FiOS Gateway Router
